# Hierarchical-ASI-Supervision
A rigorous theoretical foundation for deception as constrained optimal control. **Part 1** 

Framework for Detecting Deceptive Alignment in ASI

# About
This repo contains a `Monte Carlo simulation environment` designed to model the `Treacherous Turn` in advanced AI systems. Unlike traditional safety monitors that track simple output thresholds, this project implements a Statistical Lie Detector using **Shannon Entropy** to identify when an agent is masking "Hidden Risk" behind a "Safe" visible veneer.
